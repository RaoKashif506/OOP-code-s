//16.4 Virtual Functionsect.
//Virtual Means existing in effect but not in reality.
//A type of function that appeak to exist in some part of a program but does not 
//exist really is called virtual function.
//Virtual functions are used to implement polymorphism.
//They enable the user to execute completely different functions by the same function call.
//A virtual function is defined in the parent class and can be overridden in child classes.
//It is defined by using the keywordÂ virtual.
